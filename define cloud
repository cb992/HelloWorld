A cloud technology can bee defined as any (resource)service on rent.
The rent we pay  is only for the service we use, since there is no locking period.

we can have different types of cloud servies and there are more than one types of cloud.
namely
1) public cloud
2) private cloud
3) hibrid cloud( it is the mixture of both public and private cloud.)

public cloud: any one can use this, may that be a individual or any  organization example, schools or companies.

private cloud: owned by single organization.

most popular cloud vendors are 
1) Amazon--> AWS
2) Microsoft--> Azure
3) Google--> GCP(google cloud as platform)

Advantages:

There are number of advantages which we can discuss here, but to make this simple and short we will discuss ec2-user in detail.

ec2-user is the virtual laptop, where we can choose the config. depending upon the requreiment, and we can rent the services which we need,
and have to pay on hourly basis depending upon the use.

if we do not need any services we can stop the instances and we just have to pay for the volume of the storage which is in use.

Dynamically able to upscale and downscale the config. is a huge plus to any organization and having all this available at any point of the world at any time is a bless.
